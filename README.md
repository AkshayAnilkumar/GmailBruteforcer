Email brute forcing tool is a simple python based Password cracking tool which is designed for dictionary attack on Email login portal.

The brute-force attack is still one of the most popular password cracking methods. Nevertheless, it is not just for password cracking. Brute-force attacks can also be used to discover hidden pages and content in a web application. This attack is basically “a hit and try” until you succeed. This attack sometimes takes longer, but its success rate is higher. 

The password cracker runs a program on the computer against a dictionary, and uses some basic human behavior knowledge to continually create passwords until they find a match between the encrypted value they took from you, and the value they generated in their random password file.
